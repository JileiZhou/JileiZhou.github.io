I am currently an associate professor in School of Information at Renmin University of China. I got my Ph.D. degree in Management Science and Engineering ( Information Systems) from Guanghua School of Management, Peking University in 2020, under the supervision of Prof. Fei Ren. My research interests are mainly on business intelligence and healthcare IT.
